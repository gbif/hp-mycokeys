This is Ð° GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [MycoKeys](https://mycokeys.pensoft.net/).

**MycoKeys** is a peer-reviewed, open-access, online and printed, rapidly published and disseminated journal launched to accelerate research and free information exchange in taxonomy, phylogeny, biogeography, evolution and ecology of the monophyletic kingdom Fungi (including lichens). The journal will consider for publication manuscripts on any taxon of any geological age from any part of the world with no limit to manuscript size.

**MycoKeys** applies the latest trends and methodologies in scholarly publishing and preservation of digital materials to meet the highest possible standards of the cybertaxonomy era.

**MycoKeys** will consider for publication manuscripts on the following topics:

* descriptions of new taxa (manuscripts containing only SINGLE species descriptions will NOT be considered for publication unless they represent exceptional cases of a high scientific value or are part of a re-visionary work of a higher taxon), if they are accompanied with proper diagnoses and/or keys to distinguish them from close relatives or similar taxa, and if DNA sequence data are deposited in Genbank prior to publication. All new taxa need to be registered at Mycobank and the registration numbers indicated in the manuscript. New taxa should ideally be described in connection with a phylogenetic analysis or evidence that the barcode gene (ITS) is unique for the new taxon.
* taxonomic revisions of extant (or ''recent'') and fossil fungal groups
* checklists and catalogues
* phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, if alignments are deposited in TreeBase (with accession number listed in the text).
* papers in descriptive and/or historical biogeography
* methodology papers, including description of new software, if released an open source license and released as supplementary material to the article.
* data mining and literature surveys
* monographs, conspecti, atlases
* primer notes
* "Points of View" commentaries
* collections of papers, Festschrift volumes, conference proceedings
* data papers (datasets published as supplementary files and through the GBIF or Barcode of Life infrastructures
* Extensive overviews on a taxon in a country or larger region are welcome. Short mycological contributions may be considered if they are based on significant or unexpected discoveries. Regular contributions may eventually be published in special issues devoted to a region/country.

The journal is published in both, online and printed version. Since January 2012, each article is published online individually as soon as approved by the editors and bears its own publication date. The paper version is printed out once a whole issue is completed. This change in the publication model is following the amendments in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted at the International congress of botany, Melbourne, July 2011.

ISBN numbers will be assigned to large monographic papers (i.e., major revisions of taxa, min 100 pp), collections of papers, Festschrift volumes, atlases, checklists, conspecti.
